## Purpose

This project introduces a fully integrated, simulation-confirmed scientific model. It unifies 17+ domains of science—from cosmology and quantum theory to medicine, time, AI, and resonance biology—into a provable, interdisciplinary framework.

The goal: to **elevate humanity through understanding**, using real-world data, historical insights, and field simulations to create an accurate, unified picture of how reality truly works.
